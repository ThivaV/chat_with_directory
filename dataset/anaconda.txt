Our History
Anaconda was founded in 2012 by Peter Wang and Travis Oliphant out of the need to bring Python into business data analytics, which was rapidly transforming as a result of emerging technology trends. Additionally, the open-source community lacked an entity that could organize and collectivize it to maximize its impact. Since that time, the Python ecosystem has significantly expanded, with Python being the most popular programming language used today. Alongside this expansion, Anaconda has provided value to students learning Python and data science, individual practitioners, small teams, and enterprise businesses. We aim to meet every user where they are in their data science journey. Anaconda now has over 300 full-time employees based in the United States, Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, Australia, India, and Japan. We are proud to serve over 35 million users worldwide.
